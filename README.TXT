This repository hosts the programs developed for GSoC-2016 Project 
"Open Source Science Experiments and Data Acquisition System for Physics Education and Research with ExpEYES - Pocket Science Lab" (https://goo.gl/GKlzPh) 
As a part of GSoC-16 Project, we are also working on developing new portable Lab Tool which will be the main component of Fossasia Science Lab. 
This new interface is inspired from ExpEYES (www.expeyes.in)

Mentor Organization: FOSSASIA (http://fossasia.org/)
